Getting Started with a Base Web Application

This section is a guide for users or developers who are just starting with the web application. It aims to provide an overview of the essential features and functionalities implemented in the base version of the application.

Key Features:

Two Factor Authentication Element:

This feature enhances the security of the web application by implementing two-factor authentication (2FA). Two-factor authentication typically involves the user providing two different authentication factors, such as a password and a unique code sent to their mobile device.

Expiration of the Current User Password:

The application is designed to enforce a password expiration policy. Users will be required to change their passwords after a certain period, promoting better security hygiene.

Recovery Password Process:

In case a user forgets their password or is locked out of their account, there is a recovery password process in place. This process likely involves verifying the user's identity through predefined security questions, email verification, or other methods.

Warning Password Expiration:

To proactively remind users to update their passwords before they expire, the application generates warnings or notifications when the password is nearing its expiration date. This helps users maintain the security of their accounts.

Basic Encryption Process:

The application incorporates a basic encryption process to secure sensitive information, such as user credentials and other confidential data. Encryption ensures that data is transformed into a secure format, making it difficult for unauthorized individuals to access or interpret.
